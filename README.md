# FOLPSpipe
This repository contains the latest version of the FOLPS code.

## To-Do List

- Include `bG2` and `bGamma3` rotation

- Update the `jax_tools.py` file

- Implement a function to compute the non-wiggle component, including extrapolation:  
  `pnw(k, pk, h)`

- Develop a function to perform IR resummation for the linear power spectrum:  
  `ir_resum_linear(k, pk, h)`
